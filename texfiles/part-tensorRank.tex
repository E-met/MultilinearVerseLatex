In this part, we study upper and lower bound methods for several notions of rank. In particular, we cover apolarity theory, following \cite{IK99}, and standard algorithms for tensor rank.

Following the historical development of the subject, we present most of the algorithms first in the setting of symmetric tensors, then illustrate generalizations to the more general setting. Some basics of commutative algebra are assumed.
