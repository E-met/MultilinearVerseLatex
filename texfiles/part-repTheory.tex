Representation theory is the systematic study of symmetries of geometric and algebraic objects. Typically, in the presence of symmetries, computational tasks, proofs, and more generally the study of a mathematical object become easier and more structured because of a group action.

The varieties introduced in \ref{introduction-section-decomposable_tensors}, their secant varieties, and varieties contructed \emph{functorially} from them are examples of varieties invariant under group actions. Representation theory plays a crucial role in the study of their equations and more generally their algebraic properties.
