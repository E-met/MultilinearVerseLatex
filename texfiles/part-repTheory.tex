Representation theory is the systematic study of symmetries of geometric and algebraic objects. Typically, in the presence of symmetries, computational tasks, proofs, and more generally the study of a mathematical object become easier and more structured because of a group action.

The varieties introduced in \ref{introduction-section-decomposable_tensors}, their secant varieties, and varieties contructed \emph{functorially} from them are examples of varieties invariant under group actions. Representation theory plays a crucial role in the study of their equations and more generally their algebraic properties.

We assume some background on representation theory, to the level of \cite[Ch.6]{Lan12}; for a detailed introduction, we refer to \cite{FH91}. In \ref{reptheory-chapter-preliminaries}, we introduce some notation and important facts that will be used throughout. We refer to \ref{introduction-section-groupactions} for some notation on group actions
