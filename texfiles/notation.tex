Given a vector space $V$, $\bbP V$ denotes the projective space of lines in $V$; $V^*$ denotes the dual space of $V$. For spaces $V ,W$, $V \otimes W$ denotes the tensor product of $V$ and $W$; it can be equivalently be identified with the space of linear maps $\Hom(V^*,W) \simeq \Hom(W^*,V)$ or with the space of bilinear map $V \times W \to \bbC$.

For $d \geq 0$, let $V^{\otimes d}$ denote the $d$-th tensor power of $V$. Then $S^d V \subseteq V^{\otimes d}$ denotes the subspace of symmetric tensors, which are those tensors invariant under the action of the symmetric group $\frakS_d$ acting by permutation on the tensor factors; if the base field has characteristic $0$, $S^d V$ can be identified with the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree $d$ on $V^*$. For a subset $S \subseteq V$, let $\langle S \rangle$ denote the linear span of $S$; if $S \subseteq \bbP V$, the same notation refers to the projective linear span.
