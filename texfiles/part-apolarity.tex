In this part, we study apolarity theory, in many of its forms. The part starts introducing the notion of Macaulay's inverse systems. Some basics of commutative algebra are assumed.

Following the historical development of the subject, we present most of the algorithms first in the setting of symmetric tensors, then illustrate generalizations to the more general setting.
